# Gophercises Solutions


This repository contains my attemts at each of the Golang exercises from [calhoun.io](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises). Each directory represents its own exercises and contains a readme about the details of that exercise.


## Running

Each directory is self contained and will contain all the `.go` files that are needed, and any additional helper files. Choose which one you want to run and use `go build foo.go` to build that file and then run `./foo` to execute that binary.
